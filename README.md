## How to use Widgets

Widgets are downloaded alongside supported apps from the App Store. They require iOS 14 to be installed on your iPhone or iPad to use. To add one to your Home Screen, touch and hold anywhere on the Home Screen. Once the app icons start jiggling, you should notice a button with a plus sign (+) in the corner of the screen. Tap that button to pull up the list of apps with widgets you can add.

Each app can have multiple widgets for different tasks, and each widget can have multiple sizes for small, medium, and large. Not all widgets will include all sizes, however. When you find a widget you want to add in the size you want, tap "Add Widget" to add it to your Home Screen. You can then move it around like any app icon, or tap it to open into the relevant app. You can also add the Smart Stack, which lets you put multiple widgets in one space, and the Smart Stack will rotate between them automatically based on context.

You can include multiple copies of a single widget, at the same or different sizes, to different home screens. This can be useful for widgets that show one piece of information, such as the price of a given stock. Widgets can also have individual settings, such as which stock symbol to show. Tap a widget when editing the Home Screen, and if it supports settings, it will flip around to let you change them.
